# Portal API reference

The Django backend behind the Mentor Portal. This describes what is built and running. The code is in `backend/portal/` (`views.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`) and is covered by `backend/portal/tests.py`.

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000` locally, the deployed backend in production. Every path below starts with `/api/`.

## Conventions

**Authentication.** Every endpoint except `GET /api/health/` needs the signed-in member's Clerk session token:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <Clerk session token>
```

The backend verifies the token's signature, issuer, expiry (with 10 seconds of clock tolerance) and the site it was issued to, then maps it to a local user, creating one on first sight. The website gets the token from Clerk's `getToken()`. Nothing in a request body is ever trusted as "who is asking": the caller always comes from the token.

**Ids.** Every id is an integer. A member's id is the same everywhere (`id`, `fromId`, `toId`, `memberIds`, `senderId`).

**Times.** ISO 8601 UTC strings, e.g. `2026-09-28T01:00:53.789497Z`.

**Ownership is checked in the query.** Asking for something that isn't yours returns **404**, the same as something that doesn't exist, so ids can't be probed.

**Errors.**

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Validation failed. The body is a message, a list of messages, or `{field: [messages]}`. |
| 401 / 403 | Missing, invalid or expired token. |
| 404 | Not found, or not yours. |
| 429 | Rate limit hit. See below. |

**Rate limits** (per signed-in member): 600 requests/minute overall. Writes only: connection requests 30/day, messages 60/minute, uploads (resume and photo) 20/hour. Reads are never counted against the write limits.

## Health

`GET /api/health/` (no auth) returns `{"success": true, "message": "UPSA Django backend is running!"}`.

## The signed-in user

`GET /api/users/me/` returns `{"id": <int>, "clerk_id": "<clerk user id>"}`. Useful for checking a token works.

## Profiles

A profile is created empty the first time `/api/members/me/` is called.

```text
id                  integer (read only)
name, headline      strings
university, major   strings
company, role       strings (professionals)
industry, location  strings
bio                 string
skills              array of strings
availability        { mentor, networking, referrals }   booleans, all off by default
isProfessional      read only. The verified flag that drives the "Mentor / Professional" tag
                    and whether the member shows up in Discover. Only an admin sets this,
                    in the Django admin panel - never through this API, so nobody can list
                    themselves as verified without review.
professionalRequested   boolean. A member sets this themselves, alongside company/role/
                        industry/location, to ask an admin to review and verify them.
                        Setting it does not make isProfessional true by itself.
deactivated         boolean, hides the profile from Discover and from other members
avatarUrl, hasAvatar   read only; the photo (see below)
emailNotifications  boolean, default true. Only the owner ever sees this field.
```

| Method and path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/members/me/` | Your profile. |
| `PATCH /api/members/me/` | Partial update of any field above except `id`, `isProfessional`, `avatarUrl`, `hasAvatar` (sending `isProfessional` is silently ignored, not an error). If you send `availability`, send all three keys. |
| `GET /api/members/{id}/` | Someone else's profile. 404 if they are deactivated. Never includes email or resume, and omits `emailNotifications`. |

**Profile photo.** JPG, PNG or WEBP, up to 5 MB.

| Method and path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/members/me/avatar/` | Multipart form, field `file`. Returns 201 and the profile. Replaces any existing photo (the old file is deleted). |
| `DELETE /api/members/me/avatar/` | Removes the photo and its file. Returns 200 and the profile. |

The upload must be a real image (it is decoded and checked), no more than 25 million pixels, and is stored as a small WebP of at most 256 pixels on its longest side. The original is not kept. `avatarUrl` is a full URL when R2 is configured (public photos are cached by browsers and the CDN for a year; every upload gets a new name), or a path on the backend in local development.

## Discover

`GET /api/professionals/`: paginated, 20 per page, ordered by name. Response is `{count, next, previous, results: [profile, ...]}`; `next` is `null` on the last page.

Lists only members who are a professional, not deactivated, and have **mentor or networking turned on**.

| Query parameter | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `page` | Page number, default 1 |
| `search` | Case-insensitive match on name, headline, role, company or skills |
| `company`, `industry`, `university` | Case-insensitive partial match |
| `availability.mentor=true` | Only people open to mentoring |
| `availability.networking=true` | Only people open to networking |

## Connection requests

```text
id, fromId, toId, requestType, message, status, createdAt
requestType   networking | mentorship | referral
status        pending | accepted | declined | cancelled
```

Requests never expire. They stay pending until accepted, declined or cancelled.

| Method and path | Who | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/requests/?direction=incoming` or `outgoing` | you | Default `incoming`. Not paginated. |
| `POST /api/requests/` | you | Body `{toId, requestType, message}`. `fromId` comes from the token. 400 if you send it to yourself, or if a pending request already exists between the two of you in either direction. Emails the recipient. |
| `POST /api/requests/{id}/accept/` | recipient only, while pending | Returns 201 and the new **connection**. Emails the requester. |
| `POST /api/requests/{id}/decline/` | recipient only, while pending | Returns the request. No reason is taken, and only the requester ever learns of it. |
| `POST /api/requests/{id}/cancel/` | requester only, while pending | Returns the request. |

## Connections

```text
id, requestId, memberIds [a, b], status, since, lastMessage
status        active | completed | cancelled
lastMessage   { text (first 140 characters), senderId, createdAt } or null
```

`lastMessage` is stored on the connection, so listing connections shows a preview of every conversation without a query per conversation.

| Method and path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/connections/` | Yours only. Not paginated. |
| `POST /api/connections/{id}/complete/` | Either member. Returns the connection. |
| `POST /api/connections/{id}/cancel/` | Either member. Returns the connection. |

## Messages

```text
id, connectionId, senderId, text, createdAt
```

| Method and path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/connections/{id}/messages/` | The latest 200 messages, oldest first. Either member. A long conversation never gets slower to open. |
| `POST /api/connections/{id}/messages/` | Body `{text}`. 400 if the connection is cancelled. Emails the other member, at most once per conversation per 15 minutes. |

There is no realtime channel, read receipts or typing indicators. An open conversation re-fetches its messages every 5 seconds; everything else uses the change check below.

## Change check

`GET /api/sync/` returns `{"version": "<string>"}`. The version changes whenever one of your requests or connections changes (a connection also changes on every new message), and is `"0"` if you have none. It costs two indexed queries and a few bytes.

The portal calls this every 30 seconds (each tab is randomly offset by up to 20% so tabs never all ask at once) and only downloads profile, requests, connections and resume when the version differs from the last one it saw. Idle tabs therefore cost almost nothing: for a member with 20 conversations this replaced about 150 requests and 390 queries a minute with 2 requests and 4 queries.

## Resume

One resume per member. PDF, DOC or DOCX, up to 5 MB. Private always: it is never included in any list, only served to its owner or a connection it was shared with.

```text
id, fileName, sizeLabel, uploadedAt, sharedWith [connection ids]
```

| Method and path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/resume/` | Yours, or `null` if none. |
| `POST /api/resume/` | Multipart form, field `file`. Returns 201. Replaces an existing resume (old file deleted). |
| `DELETE /api/resume/` | Returns 204. The file is deleted. |
| `POST /api/connections/{id}/share-resume/` | Grants that one connection access. Returns 204. |
| `GET /api/resume/{id}/download/` | The file itself, streamed. 404 unless you own it or a connection you belong to has been granted it. |

## Emails

The backend emails a member about a new request, an accepted request, and a new message. Emails only say that something happened and link to the portal; they never contain what was written. Members opt out with `emailNotifications`. Addresses are looked up from Clerk at send time and never stored.

## Known limits

- Request and message text have no length cap beyond the general request-size limit (about 2.5 MB).
- There is no reporting or blocking between members.
